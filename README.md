##  Hi, I’m Abel Bitrus Duba (AbelTrust)

I’m a **Computer Science graduate** and an **entry-level Cybersecurity enthusiast** with a background in **software development, embedded systems, and community leadership**.  
I enjoy understanding how systems are built — and more importantly, how they can be **secured**.

My journey started with web and software development, and over time I intentionally transitioned into **cybersecurity (Blue Team)**, focusing on fundamentals, Linux security, authentication systems, phishing prevention, and critical infrastructure awareness.
